1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alcohol is the most harmful substance on earth.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Every year, it kills more people than terrorism, wars, homicides and car accidents combined.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It injures tens of millions in accidents, violence and crime, while keeping hundreds of millions trapped in disease.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If it didn't exist already, inventing it today would be unthinkable.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And yet, more than two billion people drink.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Most of us can't imagine a barbecue without beer, a wedding without wine or a fancy sware without champagne.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have a drink at the weekend because it's the weekend.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But also after work, where we're stressed and when we're relaxed, sad and happy, at home and outside.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Alcohol is kind of a paradox. Why do we cling so much to the thing that harms us the most?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You after one drink.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alcohol is a biological weapon that yeast produces during fermentation to wipe out its competition.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In alcoholic drinks, it's mixed with water and flavored with everything from fruits to caramel.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
With just one sip, six stillions of alcohol molecules flood your stomach and small intestine.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From there, they head to your liver, your primary detox center and to other organs like the brain.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But your liver can only process about one sip of beer every five minutes.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, unless you drink really slowly, it will become overwhelmed while an ever-growing swarm floods your brain.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Here's where the chaos begins.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The legion of intruders fills your brain and starts messing with neurotransmitters and receptors.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Their sabotage is so complex that scientists aren't fully sure yet about all their mechanisms.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we know that alcohol numbs your neurons, making them slower and disrupts their communication.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This has several effects. It sedates you, melting away tension and stress.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It stuns your prefrontal cortex, your center for decision-making and self-control,

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
making you more disinhibited and prone to say or do things that you normally wouldn't.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And it releases endorphins, feel good molecules, deeply tied to human connection.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The chemicals that we produce when we laugh, sing or dance with others,

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and which help us turn fleeting moments into shared memories.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, after a drink or three, the world doesn't only feel lighter, it feels lighter with others.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The invisible walls of insecurity around us begin to soften and you find yourself becoming a little more you.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Less afraid to talk, laugh, sing or share joys and sorrows.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Conversations flow easier, smiles last a little longer,

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and strangers can become friends or lovers more easily.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, for a while, it feels like the weight of being human isn't yours to carry alone.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alcohol sits at a sweet spot of gentle relaxation, mild courage and friendly companionship

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
that makes it the perfect social lubricant, one that comes with quite a few costs.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your body on regular drinking.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
For billions, these rounds become more frequent over time.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The occasional drink becomes a weekly habit than a ritual every other day,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
catching up with friends or unwinding, and there's always this buddy who drinks way more and has a perfectly normal life.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But as the rounds add up over years, the damage builds up.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The alcohol molecule can dissolve in water and fat, which allows it to invade almost every cell and tissue.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And when your body breaks it down, it transforms into acetaldehyde,

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the chemical that's even more toxic than alcohol itself, and that wreaks havoc on your tissues, cells and DNA.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In your brain, this shrinks your neurons and severs their connections,

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
making it harder for different parts of the brain to communicate.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
As your brain withers, your memories fade, your thinking slows down,

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and your risk of dementia increases.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
When and how you drink matters, the young you are, the wider the damage,

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and the more you drink in mango, the worse you'll make it.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The human brain isn't fully white until you're mid-twenties,

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
so drinking before that age is like smashing wet cement before it's set.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In 20-year-olds, blackout drinking episodes have been found to cause mental problems for up to a year,

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
forgetting why you entered a room or having difficulty learning new things.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Binge drinking in late adolescence is also one of the highest risk factors for early onset to mention.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then there's cancer.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just as smoking hits your lungs, alcohol causes eight types of cancer,

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
basically everywhere from mouth to bowel, plus breast cancer in women.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here, risks start at an average consumption of less than one glass of wine per day.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Beyond that, risks increase.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Worldwide, alcohol causes around 740,000 new cancer cases per year,

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
leading to 400,000 deaths.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Another victim is your liver.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Alcohol disrupts fat metabolism, causing fat to build up in your liver cells.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But this often has no symptoms, so you make your one drinking as your liver slowly turns to fat,

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
swells with inflammation and starts to fail.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The final stage is cirrhosis.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Your liver is full of scars and barely functioning.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This might take over 10 years, but once it appears, it's largely irreversible.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Every year, 600,000 people die because they have a liver destroyed by alcohol.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Drinking also weakens your heart, raises blood pressure and increases the risk of stroke and thrombosis,

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
leading to another 500,000 deaths from cardiovascular diseases every year.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In terms of looks too, alcohol damages cells around your body including your skin,

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
which looks older sooner.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And not only does alcohol contain a lot of calories itself,

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it also makes many people very hungry.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Drinking is a huge source of weight gain and increases the risk,

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
obesity, opening the door to a cascade of other health problems.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When scientists crunch these numbers,

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
they see that health problems can start at about one year a day

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and that the chances of premature death start rising significantly at around three bears a day for men

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and less than two for women.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If this sounds like a lot to you, maybe look around.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In the EU, the average man drinks the equivalent of almost three bears a day.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The average woman, almost one.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Similar figures apply to much of the world, especially the West.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's no other drug we consume that gets so close to the edge of harm.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It isn't only your body.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Alcohol is unique for another reason.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's unmatched ability to destroy others.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Alcohol causes a staggering amount of accidents.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The numbness and disinhibition of a few drinks can more fuel into a clumsy critter

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
eager to take really stupid risks on a balcony at sea or on the road.

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Every year, alcohol-fueled accidents kill 500,000 people,

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
300,000 of them in car accidents.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But more than half of the people who died in those crashes didn't drink.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They just died because someone else did.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Alcohol is also one of the major causes of violence

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
from flights of the pub to domestic abuse, other brutal assaults and murder.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Figures differ by country, but essentially 50% of all violent crime and sexual assault is committed by drunk offenders.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Each year, alcohol-fueled crime kills about 100,000 people.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's a city like Pisa being massacred every year by a drunk mob.

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then you have all the non-lethal victims.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In England alone, 500,000 adults are injured every year in accidents caused by drunk people.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Another 800,000 get hurt in violent attacks by drunk offenders.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Zoomed out to the rest of the drinking world, this means that every year dozens of millions

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
are physically harmed by someone else's drinking.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The most innocent bystanders are the 600,000 babies born every year with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
a devastating lifelong condition caused by drinking during pregnancy.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Alcohol is nothing short of a global catastrophe.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The final toll, the hijacking of 400 million lives.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
When your drinking escalates to a point that it causes real harm to yourself or others,

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
you've crossed the invisible line to alcoholism.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
An estimated 400 million people, one in 14 adults, are in this territory.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The line is very fuzzy and varies from person to person,

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
but if you consistently drink eight beers per week as a woman, 15 as a man,

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
or five on the same day, you either cross the line or are dangerously walking towards it.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Of those 400 million, more than half have fallen into an even deeper trap, dependence.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When an alcohol has become something that you physically or psychologically need.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In Europe and the Americas, one in 20 adults are caught in this web.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The stereotype of alcoholism is one of extremes.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A homeless person clutching a bottle or an always drunk father shouting at his kids,

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but it can be far more silent.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A US study found that up to 50% of all alcoholics may fly under the radar.

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They come in two main groups, unproblematic young adults,

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and middle-aged professionals with successful careers and families.

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As one of them, you'll show no anti-social behaviour.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You'll fulfill your obligations.

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You'll probably have no diagnosed health conditions.

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But on average, you'll be having four beers a day and will get drunk every week.

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And neither you nor your family may notice.

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No one questions a drink at dinner after work or at a party,

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but it's exactly that that makes alcohol so dangerous.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No other drug is so widely accepted, casually consumed and easily ignored.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, okay, how did we come to this?

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A pact with the devil.

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We made a pact with alcohol to help us solve one of the greatest challenges of being human.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Human interaction is messy.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We long for closeness, but we're also anxious, awkward and wary of each other.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Am I talking too much? Do they actually like me?

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What if I say something stupid?

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There are many ways to navigate this.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Alcohol is not the solution, but it is definitely one of them.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It is a real and effortless solution to the problem of connecting with others.

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Studies confirm what we've known for millennia.

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What is quantities of alcohol help strangers bond.

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And individuals who drink moderately and socially tend to have more friends,

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
closer friendships and higher levels of trust in others.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So, if we want to step away from alcohol, we need to be honest about what we gain from it.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
For millennia, we've been giving it our health and years of our lives.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And in return, alcohol gave us confidence, connection and celebration.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But right now, this is changing rapidly.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Younger generations, and especially Jen Z, are drinking far less than their parents did.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In the US, the share of 18-year-olds who have ever tried alcohol has dropped by 25% in the last decades.

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Binge drinking in adolescence has plummeted by 50%.

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And even in countries like Germany or France, where beer and wine have always been part of the cultural DNA,

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
alcohol consumption is falling.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And that's a victory, fewer accidents, fewer hospital beds filled, fewer lives quietly derailed.

157
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But at the same time, other things have been falling too.

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The share of young people who see their friends almost every day has plummeted by 50%.

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Attendance of parties has fallen by 30%.

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Dating and casual sex have fallen by a similar amount.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
All while loneliness and mental health issues have skyrocketed.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There are many different reasons for this, from Covid to social media.

163
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But the shift in which drugs we consume is probably not totally unrelated either.

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Drugs like weed have gained ground massively, and in contrast to drinking,

165
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
smoking weed tends to make many people less energetic and likely to do things,

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
more socially awkward, and especially if you use a lot of it, more lonely.

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Alcohol has been a powerful and influential tool for sharing,

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
celebrating and enjoying life with others for thousands of years.

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If the West is on the path to drinking less, we might also be on the path to something completely new.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
A future where we connect and rejoice without a poisonous chemical crutch,

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
or at least without this specific one.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's up to us to figure out what comes next.

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There are so many other ways to strengthen your confidence and to make connections

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
by doing the things you're passionate about by working towards the future,

175
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
by investing time into your dreams, like starting your own business.

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
With the help of today's sponsor Odoo, a business management software,

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you can do the first step of starting a new business in three minutes.

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't believe me, I bet you five ducks, and you and I will do it together.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can try Odoo for free by clicking this button here.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The first application stays free forever with unlimited hosting and support.

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's select the e-commerce application to set up an online store.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Then you just follow the e-commerce configurator.

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In a few quick steps, your website is ready to edit.

184
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Customize everything with an intuitive drag and drop editor

185
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that feels more like play than work.

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Adding products is just as simple.

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Give them a name and set a price.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Once the product is created, customize its page by adding images, a description,

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and adjusting the layout with content blocks, then it's live.

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Behind the scenes, you can fine tune the essentials, taxes, payment methods, and shipping options.

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And just like that, you're not only online, you're ready to start selling.

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's it. You did the first big step.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You owe me five ducks, and you're ready to start your business.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But Odoo offers so much more.

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
